# Angular Trunk based Development with Feature Flags

Showcase of:

1. Services, directives etc to utilize Feature Flags
2. Commit history and PR's
3. Refactor

## Whats is missing in this repo but should be essential for production ready code?

Tests! Test Driven Development to be precise.

Due to short-living branches, WIP feature (hidden behind Feature Flag) will eventually 
land in Production Environment. To be sure that WIP feature is hidden and safe to be deployed, you
will need tests.
